# BUILD-ENVIRONMENT.md — toolchain, dependencies, download sources

The tools are C, built with **CMake + the MSVC toolset**, statically
linked against **libwdi**. CMake is the deliberate choice: VSCode
consumes it via the CMake Tools extension (the approachable,
contribution-friendly path), and Visual Studio 2022/2026 open a CMake
project natively — so neither IDE is privileged and contributors can use
whichever they have.

## Download sources (all dependencies)

| Dependency | Source | Version | Licence | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **libwdi** | https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi | v1.5.0 | **LGPL-3.0** | The driver-install engine (same author as Zadig/Rufus). Build as a static lib. |
| **Visual Studio 2022 or 2026** | already installed on this machine | — | — | Need the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload (MSVC compiler + Windows SDK). |
| **Windows SDK** | bundled with the VS C++ workload | current | — | Provides `setupapi.lib`, `cfgmgr32.lib`, `newdev.lib` for the restore path. |
| **CMake** | bundled with VS2022/2026; or https://cmake.org/download/ | ≥ 3.20 | BSD-3 | VSCode "CMake Tools" can use the VS-bundled CMake. |
| **Unity** (optional test fw) | https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity | latest | MIT | Only if you prefer it over the zero-dependency CTest+assert approach. |
| **usb.ids** (optional) | http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids | rolling | public | Only if you want libwdi to resolve vendor names; not required. |

**No separate WDK / WinUSB redistributable download is needed on Windows
10/11.** WinUSB (`winusb.sys`) ships in-box since Windows 7; the WDK
co-installer DLLs (`WinUSBCoInstaller2.dll`, `WdfCoInstaller0*.dll`) are
only needed for Windows XP/Vista targets and are absent from the modern
Windows 10 SDK. The libwdi source requires two small patches (see Step 1
below) to build without those DLLs while still generating a correct
WinUSB `.inf`.

## Before you start — Windows security settings

Freshly compiled executables are unsigned.  Windows 11's Smart App
Control and Windows Defender's real-time scanner can silently block them
from running, producing "An Application Control policy has blocked this
file" when you try to run the probe or `ctest`.  Third-party products
such as Acronis True Image exhibit the same behaviour via their Active
Protection modules.

**See [`docs/WINDOWS-DEV-SETTINGS.md`](WINDOWS-DEV-SETTINGS.md) for the
exact steps** (Smart App Control, Defender folder exclusions, Acronis
trusted paths).  Configure those settings once on each developer machine
before attempting a build.

## Step 1 — Get and build libwdi as a static library

```bat
git clone https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi.git
cd libwdi
git checkout v1.5.0   # commit 90278c5
```

libwdi builds with its own MSVC solution (it does not ship CMake). Before
building, make the following changes (patches apply to commit `90278c5`;
items 4–5 are not in the upstream source yet —
upstream issue: https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/issues/368):

**`msvc/config.h`**

1. **Comment out `WDK_DIR`, `LIBUSB0_DIR`, and `LIBUSBK_DIR`** — we only
   need WinUSB, and the Win8-era co-installer DLLs referenced by those
   defines do not ship in the modern Windows 10 SDK.  Add
   `#define USER_DIR "C:/nonexistent-placeholder"` (any path) to satisfy
   the compile-time check in `embedder.h` that requires at least one
   driver-directory macro.
2. **Keep `#define WDF_VER 1011`** — used unconditionally in `libwdi.c` to
   version-stamp the WinUSB INF; remove it and the build fails with
   `C2065: 'WDF_VER': undeclared identifier`.
3. **Comment out `#define OPT_ARM`** — ARM64 cross-compiler not present on
   this host.

**`libwdi/libwdi.c`**

4. **Patch `wdi_is_driver_supported` so WinUSB always returns `TRUE`.**
   The default code gates WinUSB on `#if defined(WDK_DIR)`, which returns
   `FALSE` when `WDK_DIR` is unset — causing libwdi to silently fall back
   to the Generic USB CDC (usbser) driver.  Replace the gated block with
   an unconditional `return TRUE;`:

   ```c
   // Before:
   case WDI_WINUSB:
   #if defined(WDK_DIR)
       return TRUE;
   #else
       return FALSE;
   #endif

   // After:
   case WDI_WINUSB:
       /* WinUSB is always in-box on Windows 7+; co-installers are not
        * required on Windows 8+ so WDK_DIR need not be set. */
       return TRUE;
   ```

**`libwdi/winusb.inf.in`**

5. **Strip the co-installer DLL entries** from `SourceDisksFiles.x86` and
   `SourceDisksFiles.amd64`, and make the `CoInstallers` sections
   no-ops (matching the ARM64 section which is already empty).  The
   unpatched template lists `WinUSBCoInstaller2.dll` and
   `WdfCoInstaller0*.dll` as source files — without them extracted the
   Windows installer fails.  On Windows 8+ those DLLs are not needed.

   Patched sections (replace with):
   ```inf
   ; Co-installers are not required on Windows 8+ where WinUSB is in-box.
   [USB_Install.NTx86.CoInstallers]
   ;

   [USB_Install.NTamd64.CoInstallers]
   ;

   [SourceDisksFiles.x86]
   ;

   [SourceDisksFiles.amd64]
   ;
   ```

**`libwdi/.msvc/libwdi_static.vcxproj` and `libwdi.sln`**

6. **Remove `installer_arm64` references** — `ProjectReference` from the
   vcxproj and `Build.0` entries for `Release|x64` in the sln.
7. **Redirect stderr in the pre-build event** (`.\embedder embedded.h 2>nul`)
   so that the non-fatal "No user embeddable files found" warning is not
   parsed as a build error by MSBuild.

After those changes, build from the command line:

```bat
MSBuild libwdi.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /m /v:m
```

The static lib lands at `x64\Release\lib\libwdi.lib` and the header is
`libwdi\libwdi.h`.

> **Static CRT consistency (important).** Build libwdi with the **static
> CRT (`/MT`)** so it matches our tools. Mixing `/MT` and `/MD` across
> libwdi and our exe causes CRT link errors and/or runtime breakage. Our
> CMake sets `/MT`; libwdi must match. In the VS project this is
> C/C++ → Code Generation → Runtime Library → **Multi-threaded (/MT)**.

Record the resulting paths; Phase 0's CMake takes them as cache vars:
- `LIBWDI_INCLUDE_DIR` → folder containing `libwdi.h`
- `LIBWDI_LIB` → full path to `libwdi.lib`

## Step 2 — Our tools' CMake project

`CMakeLists.txt` essentials (fleshed out in Phase 0):

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(ftdi-winusb-rebind C)

set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)
set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Static CRT to match libwdi and produce self-contained exes.
set(CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>")

# libwdi location — set on the command line or in CMakePresets.json
set(LIBWDI_INCLUDE_DIR "" CACHE PATH "Folder containing libwdi.h")
set(LIBWDI_LIB         "" CACHE FILEPATH "Path to libwdi.lib (static)")

# ... targets defined in later phases ...
# Link deps for libwdi + the restore path:
#   ${LIBWDI_LIB} setupapi cfgmgr32 ole32 newdev
```

Configure/build:

```bat
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ^
      -DLIBWDI_INCLUDE_DIR=C:/src/libwdi/libwdi ^
      -DLIBWDI_LIB=C:/src/libwdi/x64/Release/libwdi.lib
cmake --build build --config Release
```

(For VS2026 use its generator string, e.g. `-G "Visual Studio 18 2026"`;
confirm the exact name with `cmake --help`. In VSCode, the CMake Tools
extension picks the kit and you set the same two cache vars in
`CMakePresets.json`.)

## Step 3 — Link dependencies

The tools link, beyond libwdi:
- `setupapi.lib` — device enumeration + uninstall (restore path)
- `cfgmgr32.lib` — `CM_Reenumerate_DevNode` (restore path)
- `ole32.lib` — GUID/COM helpers used by SetupAPI
- `newdev.lib` — `DiUninstallDevice` / driver update helpers

All ship with the Windows SDK (VS C++ workload). No extra downloads.

## Verifying a clean, self-contained build

```bat
dumpbin /dependents build\Release\ftdi-unbind.exe
```

Should list only system DLLs (`KERNEL32`, `SETUPAPI`, `CFGMGR32`,
`ole32`, etc.) — no `libwdi.dll`, no `vcruntime*.dll` (because `/MT`),
no third-party DLLs. That's the goal: two drop-in `.exe`s a student runs
with no install.

## Licensing note (LGPL-3.0 static linking — not legal advice)

libwdi is **LGPL-3.0**. Static-linking LGPL code is permitted, but the
LGPL expects that an end user can **relink** against a modified libwdi.
For an open-source tool this is easy to satisfy: publish the full source
and the build instructions (this doc), which lets anyone rebuild/relink.
The cleanest options, in rough order of simplicity:

1. **License the tools under GPL-3.0** (compatible with LGPL-3.0). Then
   the relink requirement is moot because everything is open. Recommended
   for a contribution-friendly project.
2. A **permissive licence** (MIT/BSD) for the tool source, while
   documenting the relink path and shipping the libwdi source/version
   used. Also fine; slightly more to keep track of.

This is general information, not legal advice — if the project's
distribution model matters to you, confirm with someone qualified. The
practical takeaway: keep the source public with these build instructions
and you're in good shape either way.

## Where Claude Code fits

Claude Code can do Step 2–3 and all of the unit-test loop autonomously
(compile, link, `ctest`). Step 1 (building libwdi) is a one-time setup it
can also perform, but the **driver-install/restore integration tests**
(Phases 3–4) need admin + the real FT231X and are human-run — see
`CLAUDE.md` "build vs install".
